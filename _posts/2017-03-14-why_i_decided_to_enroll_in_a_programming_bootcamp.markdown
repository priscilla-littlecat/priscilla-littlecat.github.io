I remember when the Commodore 64 computers came out when I was in high school.  (Man, I am really showing my age)!  There was a magazine called Compute!Gazette that had BASIC programs at the end of the magazine, where I could type it into our Commodore and I would get a game to play on.  This was very enjoyable for me.  I sat for hours typing in the programs.  I didn't know what the lines meant, but I loved what I was doing.  Years later, I took a BASIC course as an adult at the local community college and got an A.  I also took Mathematics for Computers years later at the same college and also got an A.

I was supposed to get into computers in college after high school, but I went to nursing school instead.  I did not want to become a nurse, my Mom wanted me to.  I didn't finish nursing school; I got kicked out after a year.  I told one of my classmates I wanted to go into the computer field.  She told me I would do the same thing every day.  I got scared about that, so I didn't pursue computers.  I took her advice.  I went to college after nursing school and got my Bachelors in Chemistry.  Hated it.  But I graduated with a C average.  I got quality control jobs as a chemical lab technican.  Hated them.  My average length an any job was 2 years.  I had other odd jobs that weren't in Chemistry: temp jobs, retail jobs.  I was a job hopper, always hating what I did.

Now that I'm older, I don't want to be a job hopper anymore.  Currently, I am working in retail and I am in my 4th year at the store.  I am getting retirement through my employer and my job is helping me pay for bootcamp.  Finally, I am doing what I love (bootcamp), even though I am not a web developer yet, and I have something to look forward to.  I may face age discrimination, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it.  Right now, I am focusing on learning the concepts and passing the labs.  That way I can graduate and cross the next bridge.

In closing, I went back to the same community college in 2004 and graduated in 2006, Magna Cum Laude, with a 3.774 GPA in E-Commerce, Associate of Applied Business.  Web design was taught in that major, so I am not new to web design.  And now I will become a web developer!!!!!

I am very determined to pass and graduate AND get a job as a web developer.  I am happy now and am confident about my future.

Thank you for reading my blog.
